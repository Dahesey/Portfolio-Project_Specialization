This web application aims to streamline the process of managing attendance and financial transactions for a community or organization. By centralizing this information, the app will provide valuable insights to aid in decision-making and resource allocation.

- Assigns users roles of finance officer or frontdesk personnel.
- Oversees overall activities taking place like the statistics of attendants registered in certain month or number of services.


#### Frontdesk actions:

Adult and Child Tracking: Separate attendance records for adults and children.

Check-In/Check-Out: Easy-to-use interface for marking attendance.

#### Finance actions:

Offerings and Tithes: Record monetary contributions from members.

Welfare Support: Track financial assistance provided to members in need.

## Project Architecture and Technologies

- ReactJS: was used for handling all logics of frontend related matters.

- JSX: used alongside React to create seeming frontend components.

- HTML & CSS: for template rendering and styling purposes.

- MongoDB: this was used to act as the main database for user data and other relevant data that was to be stored for things like statistical computation.

- NodeJS: this library was used for the handling of backend logic and incorporation of databases such as MongoDB in this particular case.
